<h2 id="rouge-demo">rouge demo</h2>
<p>Perhaps the fantasy of having my own world began as early as middle school or high school, and over the years, a 30,000-word outline gradually took shape through annual refinements. Now, I feel the time has come.</p>
<p>Initially, it was envisioned as a massive visual game, but halfway through development, I realized its sheer scale was overwhelming. Consequently, I extracted the core gameplay mechanics and created a demo instead.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a brief overview of the current pages:

<img src="../images/articles/game_01/IceCave.jpg" alt="冰洞">
<img src="../images/articles/game_01/LavaCave.jpg" alt="熔岩洞">
<img src="../images/articles/game_01/StoneCave.jpg" alt="石洞">
<img src="../images/articles/game_01/CursedCave.jpg" alt="被诅咒的山洞"></p>
<p>So far, only the Tester and the Blade Master characters have been tested, with the Wolf and Bear characters likely serving more as decorative placeholders.</p>
<p>There are 20 weapons available.</p>
<p>Regarding auras, there are 27 types in total, with typically 3 tiers of advancement for each.</p>
<p>There are 24 types of minions, featuring 9 different elemental weaknesses/strengths for strategic combat.</p>
<p>Armor-wise, there are 32 pieces, though I haven&#39;t had the chance to thoroughly test them all and prefer not to elaborate further at this point.</p>
<p>Further development and details are yet to be finalized. For a more comprehensive look, please feel free to reach out via email. I&#39;ll make time to elaborate and refine the information as needed.</p>
